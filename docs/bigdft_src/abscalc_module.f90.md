# abscalc_module.f90

## Overview

*This file defines a Fortran module, `module_abscalc`, which appears to provide types and routines for calculations related to optical absorption spectra. This likely involves methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) or similar approaches for computing excited state properties, possibly with a focus on X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) as indicated by comments. It includes definitions for projector data types (`pcproj_data_type`, `PAWproj_data_type`) which are crucial for handling pseudopotential and PAW formalism components in these calculations.*

## Key Components

*List of the primary functions, classes, or modules defined in the file, with a short description of each.*

*   **MODULE module_abscalc:** The main module encapsulating all definitions and procedures.
*   **TYPE pcproj_data_type:** A derived data type to store data for preconditioning projectors, likely used in iterative methods for solving excited state equations. It includes components for DFT pseudopotential projectors (`pc_nl`), information mapping local regions to projectors, energies, and Gaussian basis details (`G`).
*   **TYPE PAWproj_data_type:** A derived data type to store data for Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) projectors. It includes components for PAW non-local projectors (`paw_nl`), mappings, and Gaussian basis information.
*   **SUBROUTINE deallocate_pcproj_data(pcproj_data):** Deallocates memory associated with a `pcproj_data_type` variable.
*   **SUBROUTINE deallocate_pawproj_data(pawproj_data):** Deallocates memory associated with a `PAWproj_data_type` variable.
*   **SUBROUTINE applyPCprojectors(...):** Applies the preconditioning projectors to wavefunctions. This is likely part of an iterative solver or a step in constructing the response function.
*   **SUBROUTINE applyPAWprojectors(...):** Applies PAW projectors to wavefunctions, handling the specifics of the PAW method in the context of absorption calculations.
*   **INTERFACE block:** Defines interfaces for several subroutines that seem to be implemented elsewhere or are intended to be provided by other modules. These include:
    *   `createPcProjectorsArrays`: Likely sets up the arrays needed for `pcproj_data_type`.
    *   `gatom_modified`: Appears to be a modified atomic calculation routine, possibly for generating basis functions or potentials relevant to core-level spectroscopy.
    *   `abs_generator_modified`: Could be a routine to generate quantities needed for the absorption calculation based on atomic data.
    *   `cg_spectra`: Suggests a Conjugate Gradient (CG) based solver for calculating spectra, a common iterative method for large linear systems arising in TDDFT.

## Important Variables/Constants

*Descriptions of any critical variables or constants defined in the file that affect its behavior.*

*   **pcproj_data_type%pc_nl (type(DFT_PSP_projectors)):** Stores the pseudopotential non-local projectors.
*   **pcproj_data_type%ecut_pc (real(gp)):** Energy cutoff for preconditioning projectors.
*   **pcproj_data_type%G (type(gaussian_basis)):** Gaussian basis set information for preconditioning.
*   **PAWproj_data_type%paw_nl (type(DFT_PSP_projectors)):** Stores the PAW non-local projectors.
*   **PAWproj_data_type%G (type(gaussian_basis_c)):** Gaussian basis set information for PAW projectors (complex version).
*   **psi, hpsi (real(wp), dimension(:), pointer):** Pointers to wavefunction arrays (psi) and Hamiltonian-applied-to-wavefunction arrays (hpsi), commonly used in iterative solvers.
*   **paw_matrix (real(wp), dimension(:), pointer):** Pointer to a PAW matrix, likely involved in transforming quantities between the smooth and all-electron representations.
*   **dosuperposition (logical):** A logical flag passed to `applyPAWprojectors`, possibly to handle superposition of atomic contributions or specific PAW augmentation regions.

## Usage Examples

*If applicable, provide examples or code snippets demonstrating how to use the functions, classes, or modules in the file.*

*A typical usage pattern within a larger BigDFT workflow for calculating absorption spectra might involve:*

1.  **Initialization:** Setting up the necessary projector data.
2.  **Main Calculation Loop:** Iteratively solving for excited states or the response function, where projector application is a key step.

## Dependencies and Interactions

*Notes on any dependencies the file has on other parts of the system or external libraries, and how it interacts with other components.*

*   **module_base, module_types:** Depends on these for fundamental constants, derived data types (`orbitals_data`, `atoms_data`, `locreg_descriptors`, `DFT_PSP_projectors`, `gaussian_basis`, etc.), and basic utility functions.
*   **psp_projectors_base:** Used for `free_DFT_PSP_projectors` to deallocate projector components.
*   **gaussians:** Used for `deallocate_gwf` (and `deallocate_gwf_c`) for deallocating Gaussian basis set data.
*   **locregs:** The `applyPAWprojectors` and `applyPCprojectors` subroutines use routines from `locregs` (e.g. `plr_segs_and_vctrs`, `wpdot_wrap`, `waxpy_wrap`).
*   **Ground-State DFT Results:** Implicitly, this module would operate on data derived from a preceding ground-state DFT calculation (e.g., wavefunctions, Hamiltonian, potential) which are inputs to the excited state calculation.
*   **Iterative Solvers:** The routines for applying projectors (`applyPCprojectors`, `applyPAWprojectors`) are essential components of iterative methods (like Conjugate Gradient, Lanczos, or Davidson algorithm) commonly used to solve the large eigenvalue problems or linear systems that arise in TDDFT calculations of absorption spectra. The `cg_spectra` in the interface block further suggests this.
*   **Overall BigDFT Workflow:** This module extends BigDFT's capabilities to simulate optical absorption spectra, providing tools to handle the complex projector formalism (especially for PAW) within such calculations.
